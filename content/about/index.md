# Dmitriy Vovk personal blog

## About me
Firstly, some words about myself. 
I'd been a DevOps trainee in Namecheap company for about a year and than on August 2021 became an Engineer and now a part of the team.
Our stack is Terraform, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes(EKS), AWS.

## About this blog 
I wanted to capture and expand the topics that I found interesting more widely for myself. Consequently, it could help someone else on the planet.

Topics that I am interested in are:

- Linux and Containers
- Networking
- Programming(I can write something using JavaScript and now learning Golang)
- Memory and learning techniques

As for my hobbies, I like running(made half-marathon but then found some issues with my knees), reading book, yoga, The Big Bang Theory.
I can post some reviews here probably in the future just for fun and curiosity.
